## 💡 Framework Highlights

### 📌 Singleton WebDriver Manager

Ensures a single driver instance is shared and reused using thread-safe Singleton pattern.

### 📦 Page Object Model

Each UI page interaction is modeled as a class. Improves readability, reusability, and maintainability.

### 🧠 Utilities & Helpers

Smart waits, element clickers, screenshot capture, and reusable logic are abstracted inside `Helper.java`.

### 🖼️ Screenshot on Failure

Screenshots are captured on every test failure and embedded into the final HTML report.

### ⚙️ CI Integration (Planned)

CI runs will be triggered on every push to `main` branch via GitHub Actions with headless browser testing.

---

## ▶️ Running the Tests

git clone https://github.com/Suyash0225/Astrojini.git

```

### ✅ CI via GitHub Actions
